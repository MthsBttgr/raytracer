# raytracer
This project is me learning about how raytracers work, and trying to build one myself. 
My raytracer is insanly basic, but pretty cool in my oppinion aswell. 
It simulates a virtual camera, from which a bunch of rays are sent out into a virtual world.
The rays interact and bounce around within this world, and the data is used to construct an image.
The image format is .ppm, which isn't great, but very easy to work with.

I followed the guide: "Raytracing in one weekend". Link: https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io.
I only completed the first book. I might return and do the others later, but right now i want to move on to other stuff.
